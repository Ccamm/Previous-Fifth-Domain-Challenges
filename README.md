# Previous Fifth Domain Challenges

Just a very unorganised repository of previous Fifth Domain challenges that will be shared with everyone if they reuse challenges for the BSides CTF.

I will not try to neaten these up since I can't be bothered.

I feel guilty that I did not bring this up during the C2C CTF, and that's why I want to remedy the reuse issue and want everyone to forgive my sins.

**Competition CTFs should not have reused challenges! We all want to learn something new and have fun!**

*Forgot to take screenshots for the C2C finals (my deep hatred of guessy steg challenges prevented me).*
