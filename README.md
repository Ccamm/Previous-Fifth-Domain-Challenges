# Previous Fifth Domain Challenges

Just a very unorganised repository of previous Fifth Domain challenges that will be shared with everyone if they reuse challenges for the BSides CTF.

I will not try to neaten these up since I can't be bothered.

I feel guilty that I did not bring this up during the C2C CTF, and that's why I want to remedy the reuse issue and want everyone to forgive my sins.

**Competition CTFs should not have reused challenges! We all want to learn something new and have fun!**

## Unsolvable Challenges

Technically, these could be solvable but no one has been able to in all of the CTFs it has popped up in. If you have solved it let me know.

* ~~Gothams Weather: Seen in 4 CTFs (Including BSides)~~
* Adversarial Server: Seen in 2 CTFs (Including BSides)
* Snowy Emails: Seen in 2 CTFS (Including BSides)
* Answer Key: Seen in 2 CTFs (Including BSides)
* Functionally the Same: Seen in 2 CTFs (Including BSides)
* Secret Service: Seen in 2 CTFs (Including BSides)
* Some TOR challenge I can't remember the name of: Seen in 2 CTFs (Including BSides)

# Gotham's Weather Hint

A super awesome person provided a vital hint for Gotham's Weather that I believe makes the challenge solvable. Here is the hint.

> I think you've started down the wrong path on this challenge.

> It's the weather of Gotham (Batman's city). Batman has the theme song "nananana Batman" (or better yet "NaNNaNNaNNaN Batman").
Each of the 3 weather stations have many NaNs in the data, but the binary representation of the NaNs is inconsistent (The exponent is all 1s, but values in the significand keep changing) which is not what you'd expect in a file generated by numpy.
Full disclosure - whilst not the author of this challenge, I was there when the challenge was written and the assumption was that hints like those above would be released throughout any competition it was used in. (The author is a physicist and this was their first attempt at writing a CTF challenge, having only heard of the concept the day before, so it's a bit rough around the edges)
